# UK Export Licence Data-Analysis

This repository contains data-analysis examining the export licences granted by the UK government with regard to items with explicit or potential military applications.  
The analysis itself is contained within main.ipynb.  
The main 'data' directory contains a group of csv files I created during the process of this analysis to save time on re-running the notebook.  
The files within 'data/uk-arms-export-data-2024-06-13' consititute the primary data sources used within this analyis.
  
This data was provided by 'Campaign Against Arms Trade' as part of their quarterly reporting on the military export licences provided by the UK government. This analyis and it's author is in no way affiliated with CAAT. The data is implicitly covered by an Open Government Licence.  
While most relevant points regarding the data are covered within the analysis itself it should be noted that due to the UK government transfering some data to a new, opaque database aproximately 15% of the data for 2023 is missing from this set and is unavailable to the public.

For more information regarding the data you can read [CAAT's faq](https://caat.org.uk/data/exports-uk/faq).  
The latest release of the data is available at [CAAT's github repo](https://github.com/caatdata/uk-arms-export-data).
